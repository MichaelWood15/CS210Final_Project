# CS210 Final Project

1. WEB SCRAPING
   Scraped the web for NBA Data about team offenses in the 2023-24 season. I gathered statistics on teams Offensive Ratings, the type of shots teams took, and player offensive statistics. I did this using playwright in python which is a browser testing library that allows you to navigate the internet using code. To identify webpage elements, I used Xpath which is an expression language that allows you to select webpage elements that meet certain conditions based on your query.
